3D Graphics Processing Unit
=====

This repository contains the source and mapped VHDL code for the 3D Graphics Processing Unit made for ECE337 at Purdue. It was retroactively added, but was actually completed in Fall 2010. If you want to see the animated cube demo, please go to my 3DGPU-Demo repo instead.
